# TommyJohn-Surgery-Research
Research into possible correlating factors between pitchers thrown and those who had Tommy John Surgery.

The goal of this research project was to use bayesian statistical methods to develop a method to find both correlation between pitches thrown and those who had Tommy John Surgery, and then further use these found correlations to detect if other pitchers would have to get the surgery as well. Preliminary findings and research presented at CSAS 2025 at Yale.
